# StressViz
The goal of this project is to develop an integrated system that combines Emotibit EDA data and neural networks (NNs). The system will detect stress levels based on electrodermal activity (EDA) measurements and provide real-time feedback through a user-friendly application. This project aims to enhance well-being and promote stress management.
